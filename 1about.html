        <h1>Welcome to Children's Home</h1>
        <p> Zaputuo’s unusual story began in 1973. She was then a nurse in the Kohima Government Hospital,<br> 
            a widow whose husband, a jawan in the Indian Army, had died in 1965. Only the faces of the <br>
            patients altered and her life was as tranquil as it was unchanging.
<br><br>
        One day a woman died in the hospital after giving birth to a chubby boy. <br>
        The grief stricken father left the baby behind, saying he could not look after him. <br>
        As the child lay unwanted in the ward, Zaputuo found herself thinking and worrying. <br>
        In a decision that was to change her life, she brought the child home and named him Diezelie Angami. <br>
        Bringing up Diezelie was fun, especially for Zaputuo’s only daughter Neibanuo, then just 10.<br><br>

        Three months after adopting Diezelie, Zaputuo heard the cries of a new-born while passing by a thickly wooded area in Kohima. <br>
        Venturing inside, she found an abandoned baby boy in a bamboo basket. Naturally the child was brought home. <br>
        In a year’s time, Zaputuo had collected five abandoned children.
        <br><br>
        The number of little ones kept ballooning and by 1982, Zaputuo had 72 children packed into three large rooms of her house. <br>
        When there wasn’t any more place a few years later, <br>
        she build the Kohima Orphan and Destitute Home – made of bamboo and tin, <br>
        and which also includes a primary school – on a parcel of government land.</p>

        <br><br>
        <p>From a plot near Raj Bhavan in 1973, the KODH was shifted to PR Hill and then to Jotsoma Village near Kohima. 
            <br>       >   However, due to various problems the home had to be shifted again and finally on 31st March, 1994, 
            <br>           the KODH moved to a plot on the Kohima-Dimapur National Highway No. 39, a few kilometers from Kohima Town, 
            <br>           where it now resides.</p>
